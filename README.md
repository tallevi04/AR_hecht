##### 3. Copy the SHA-1 fingerprint into the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint field in Google Cloud.

### How to Configure ARcore Session
##### Here we will modify the app to create a hosted anchor on a user tap instead of a regular one. To do that, you will need to configure the ARCore Session to enable Cloud Anchors.

### How to Create Hosted Anchor
##### Here we will create a hosted anchor that will be uploaded to the ARCore Cloud Anchor Service.
##### In CloudAnchorFragment.java two helper classes are called these would be responsible to create hosted anchor.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62984042/194017022-636a95a5-bb04-4112-ba9e-60152022dfd6.png)
##### •	SnackbarHelper.java ( helper/src/main/java)
##### •	CloudAnchorManager.java ( helper/src/main/java)
##### •	OnDrawFrame() Method will handle one tap per frame.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62984042/194017141-15f470e6-8a18-48e9-bc06-6325e39ab13b.png)
##### And in this method CloudAnchorManager.update () Obtain the current frame from ARSession and update the cloud anchor.

### When app was Hosting Anchor
##### User will see the app generated message at the bottom that the Anchor is being Hosted after Successfull configuration.

## Firebase
### How to work with firebase for sharing hosted anchor to Multiple devices
##### SignIn to Firebase with your Gmail (Keep the Browser open to see if the project was created from the Android Studio)
##### •	Open the code in Android Studio and head to Tools -> Firebase Panel will pop from the side.
##### •	Select Realtime Database
##### •	Connect to Firebase
##### •	Select Work Module
##### •	Press OK ( Now you will see connect dialog)
##### •	Now add real time database

##### •	In Work module build.gradle file find and remove (xxxx from the) dependencies {implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database:xxxx'}

## 3D Model Randering
##### This class is used in both Admin and Client side and it is responsible for rendering our model in the real world and it will be responsible for shading of the 3D Models you can change its material properties here.

## Methods and classed with application flow
### Splash Screen
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62984042/194028556-a315f8b6-2216-4b70-bc47-d5be39ea4cf0.png)
##### User will see a splash screen when entering the application
##### • Make sure you are connected to the internet
##### •	Now our SplashFragment.java  is triggered.
##### •	This java class will inflate the layout fragment_splash.xml which contains all the UI/UX design of the screen. It will also trigger animations like(fade in) implemented on the logo.
##### •	onCreate method is called when the fragment instance is created each time.

### Home Screen/Menu
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62984042/194029248-1dbe1a17-1510-4be6-aa10-f9f1523874ac.png)
##### •	User/Admin will see the Menu to login in.
##### •	Admin is password protected and the password is stored in the firebase 
##### •	User can enter without any restriction.
##### •	HomeFragment.java is the class for home screen it will get/inflate fragment_home.xml which is the UI for homescreen.
##### •	onClickListener() methods are used for the client choice, when pressed it will launch the next fragment or screen for the user or admin.
##### •	CustomDialog() is used to get Admin credentials

### Admin Hosting Anchor

##### • Now here Application will ask for camera permissions and detect surface
##### •	onResume() method is used to check if the device has ARcore functionality installed(if not download it from Google play store).
##### •	In case you wonder what is GLES( OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API that specifies a standard software interface for 3D graphics processing hardware. OpenGL ES is a flavor of the OpenGL specification intended for embedded devices.)
##### •	onSurfaceCreated() method is used to show 3D model and shadow configurations.
##### •	onDrawFrame() Frames are being controlled so that you only see the recently created frames it works on camera matrix, projection matrix, tracking plane surface(planeRenderer is a used for drawing 3D model and its shadows after surface detection)
##### •	handleTap() will only restrict the application from creating multiple models and only single tap will work to Host the anchor
##### •	onHostedAnchorAvailable() if every thing goes will from permessions to surface detection this method will host the generate the shortcode itself then push the anchor to the firebase.
##### •	onResolveButtonPressed() this method is used by the Admin to get the hosted anchor from the firebase using the short code.
#### Helper Classes Used to handle different Actions on User and Admin Side 
##### •	CamerPermissionHelper.java from Helper directory will handle permission related task.
##### •	CloudAnchorManager.java from Helper directory is a helper class to handle all the Cloud Anchors logic, and add a callback-like mechanism on top of the existing ARCore API.
##### •	DisplayRotationHelper.java is a Helper class to track the display rotations. In particular, the 180 degree rotations are not notified by the onSurfaceChanged() callback, and thus they require listening to the android display events.
##### •	FirebaseManager.java is used to store cloud Anchor ID’s.
##### •	SnackbarHelper.java is a helper for resolving error messages as these messages will appear on the bottom of the screen. It is Useful for notifying errors, where no further interaction with the activity is possible.
##### •	StorageManager.java is really important to understand as it is storing the Cloud Anchor ID’s on the local device.
##### •	TapHelper.java will work as intermediate to detect taps using Android GestureDetector and pass the taps between UI thread and render thread. 
##### •	TrackingStateHelper.java it will show all errors relate to person movement and enviornment both for admin and user.

### Dialog box for hosting anchor for Admin

##### •	Application will ask the user to enter the short code to resolve the anchor.
##### •	Application will perform same steps to from permissions to surface detection to showing 3D models on its respective coordinates stored on the cloud.
##### •	UserFragment.Java will perform this functionality.
##### •	ResolveDialogFragment.java from the helper directory will apply validation for numeric digits for short code

### Resolved Anchor Details
